by Pamela Nevins

Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!

Here are the rules:
1. The game has two players, X and O.  Decide which player will go first; that player will be 'X'.  
2. Take turns placing a marker (X or O) by clicking in the cells of the grid provided.  
3. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
